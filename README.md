# Book-Recommendation-System
. Performed EDA on Data and plotted the relationship between the average score and other columns in the dataset to get features for the model.
. Used the Min-Max scaler to reduce these values. It helped reduce the bias for some of the books that have too many features.
.Built an ML model with the KNN algorithm and incorporated it with the Python function to build a Book Recommendation system.
